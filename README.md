# picture-to-schematic
Turns an image into a minecraft schematic file.

# What's the purpose of this?
To help players create large obsidian designs at sky limit (like ones on 2b2t)

# Should this replace mapart maker and other image to schematic programs?
No. While this can do other blocks, this was created for the sole purpose of creating a one-to-one (pixel) ratio of pictures to obsidian schematic designs.

# How do I run this?
You can just download from the releases, otherwise you can download the files and run locally (or compile if you would like it to run faster). Required packages are tkinter, PIL, and nbtschematic

Use pip to easily install all of these.
